                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

                <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the <a href="https://www.python.org">Python Website</a> and may be freely distributed.</p>

                <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>

                <p>Before you start, you will need Python on your computer.</p>

                <p>Check whether you already have an up to date version of Python installed by entering python in a command line window. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display. Generally any Python 3.x version will do, as Python makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility within major Python versions. Python 2.x and Python 3.x are intentionally not fully compatible. If python starts a Python 2.x interpreter, try entering python3 and see if an up to date version is already installed.</p>

                <p>On Windows, try py first - this is the relatively recent Python Launcher, which has a better chance of avoiding some of the path problems that might occur because on Windows programs don't install into any of the small set of common locations that are searched by default. The Python launcher can also let you select any of the various versions you may have installed from a single command.</p>

                <h2>Windows</h2>

                <p>The most stable Windows downloads are available from the Python for Windows page. On Windows you have a choice between 32-bit (labeled x86) and and 64-bit (labeled x86-64) versions, and several flavors of installer for each. The Python core team thinks there should be a default you don't have to stop and think about, so the yellow download button on the main download page gets you the "x86 executable installer" choice. This is actually a fine choice: you don't need the 64-bit version even if you have 64-bit Windows, the 32-bit Python will work just fine.</p>

                <h2>Mac</h2>

                <p>See the Python for <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">Mac OS X </a> page. MacOS from 10.2 (Jaguar) to 10.15 (Catalina) includes a system version of Python 2, but it is best not to consider this the Python to use for your programming tasks - install a current Python 3.x version instead. MacOS after 10.15 (Catalina) will not include a default system Python.</p>

                <p>To get started with writing Python, we will start with the familiar "Hello World" in Python code.</p>
                <code>print("Hello World")</code>

                <p>Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring variables. Instead, you create a variable by assigning a value to it</p>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                    y = "John"
                    print(x)
                    print(y)

                <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters into a function. A function can return data as a result.</p>
                <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword</p>
                <p><code>def my_function():</code></p>
                <p>&emsp;<code>print("Hello from a function")</code></p>
                <P>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</P>
                <p><code>my_function()</code></p>

                </header>
                <p>In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>
                <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Text Type</li>
                    <li>Numeric Types</li>
                    <li>Sequence Types</li>
                    <li>Mapping Types</li>
                    <li>Set Types</li>
                    <li>Boolean Types</li>
                    <li>Binary Types</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="If...Else_in_Python" class="main-section">

                    <h1>If...Else in Python</h1>
                </header>

                <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Equals</li>
                    <li>Not Equals</li>
                    <li>Less than</li>
                    <li>Less than or equal to</li>
                    <li>Greater than:</li>
                    <li>Greater than or equal to</li>
                </ul>

                <p> An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword</p>
                <p><code>a = 33</code></p>
                <p><code>b = 200</code></p>
                <p><code>if b > a:</code></p>
                <p>&emsp;<code>print("b is greater than a")</code></p>
